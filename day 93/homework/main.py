# Q&A
# 1) Is str data type mutable or immutable?
# str data type is immutable, because we can't change it no matter what (except for using replace method.)

# 2) If str is immutable then how does .replace() method work? We are able to mutate our string
# when we use .replace() it doesn't actually change the string itself. it produces another string.

# 3) Are all collection types matched to their bracket types? list: [], tuple: {}, dict: {}, set: ()
# No. The correct way would be: list: [], tuple: (), dict: {}, set: {}

# 4) Is sentence "I created function" syntactically correct or not?
# No it't not syntactically correct. The correct way would be I defined a function.

# 5) If python is case-sensitive language...
# It means that "A" and "a" is treated differently.

# 6) What will print(True + True) output?
# It's gonna output 2, becaus True equals 1. Therefore (1 + 1 = 2).

# 7) What will print(int("1_000_000")) output?
# It's gonna Output 1_000_000. It is so we can easily tell what the numbers are.

# 8) What will this code output?
# კოდი არ არის ნაჩვენები, შესაბამისად კითხვას ვერ გავცემ პასუხს.

# 9) Is empty list Truthy or Falsey value?
# empty list is a Falsey value. Therefore a list containing elements is Truthy value.

# 10) What will this code output?
# კოდი არ არის ნაჩვენები, შესაბამისად კითხვას ვერ გავცემ პასუხს.

# 11) Can we create list comprehension with if statement?
# Yes we can. for example: return "even" if n % 2 == 0

# 12) Can we create list comprehension with if-else statement?
# we can. for example: return "even" if n % 2 == 0 else "odd"

# 13) Can you define function inside function?
# Yes, that's possible. For example:

def hello():
    def goodbye():
        return "Goodbye"

# 14) Is there error type called "ZeroDivisionError"?
# Yes, There is. It pops up whenever we try to divide a number by Zero.

# 15) What are lambda functions called?
# lambda functions are called "Anonymous Functions"

# 16) What are lambda functions called?
# Still "Anonymous Functions"

# 17) What will print(not "") output?
# print(not "") will output True, since print("") would be False. (an empty string is always a False value)

# 18) If someone said "Everything is an Object in python", would it be a lie?
# No, that statement would be absolutely correct.

# 19) Are "is" and "==" operators both exactly the same in python?
# "is" and "==" operators aren't exactly the same in python.

# 20) Is python high level or low level programming language?
# python is a high level programming language, which means that it's far from machine language.
