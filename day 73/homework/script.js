// scoping in js determines the range of using certain variables/variable names outside of a js code block. there are various types of scopes in js. for example: Global scope, function scope and block scope.

// with the use of hoisting, the engine of js in browsers automatically moves up a declaration of a variable to the very top of the code, which depends on the priority of a variable. we can use the variable before it is declared. (only if it's initialized by var keyword)
